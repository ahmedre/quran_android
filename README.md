Important Message from the Developers
-------------------------------------
Two years ago when we started Quran Android as an open source project,
our intention was:

 * to provide a free, highly featured Quran application on the Android
 platform.
 * to build a community where all muslims can suggest new ideas and see
them get implemented.
 * to allow muslim developers all over the world to contribute and share
thawab.
 * to allow computer science students and new Android developers to 
 learn from the source code.

Al7amdulillah, we have exceeded 2M downloads and over 1M active users,
which was a dream that wouldn't have become a reality without the mercy of
Allah followed by your du3a2s and continuous feedback.

Yet, due to irresponsible actions, a few people have cloned our app and
redistributed it without our permission.  initially, we were ok with that,
until we found that one of these apps added advertisements above each Quran 
image.  This is totally unacceptable, in addition to being disrespectful to
the word of Allah. As a result, we have decided to restrict access to our
code repository and make our code base only shared between our team members.

Please note that we **do not** have a paid version nor an ad supported 
version.  If you see an application using our source code with
advertisements or charging for it, please let us know.

We will keep this project open to keep track of specific issues, bugs, and
features that we are working on insha'Allah.  Please feel free to report
any issues or suggestions [here](http://github.com/quran_android/issues).

JazakumAllah Khairan.
