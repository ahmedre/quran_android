Terms of use
------------
you are free to use parts of the Quran Android code in your application
with some conditions:

* your app must be respectful of the book of Allah.  adding advertisements
above and below each page of Quran is unacceptable, for example (yes,
someone actually did that).

* your app must provide some significant value over our app - otherwise,
why not just contribute a patch instead?

* your app cannot make money from ads or from sales.  there are many reasons
for this:
    - we made this app for the benefit of people and not to make a profit
    - the app costs us money (for serving the pages, translations, etc), not to
mention the time to develop it and to support it.
    - not all of the data that we use is okay to be sold.  the images, along with
some of the translations are on a license that allows their use and distribution
for free for non-profit uses, but does not allow users to make money from them.

* if you write an application using any of the Quran data (the images, the
translations, etc), you must provide a link to the respective data source
page ([tanzil.net](http://tanzil.net) for the translations and the
[quran images project](http://github.com/quran/quran.com-images) for the images)
both within your application (in an about page) and in your application
description in the market or app store.

* if you use part of (or all of) the quran android code or graphics, you
must provide a link back to the [quran android
project](http://github.com/ahmedre/quran_android) in your application
description and your application itself in an about section.

Open Source Projects Used
