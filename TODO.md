**Notes and Things to Fix**

 * ProgressBars in Activity - appcompat broke these basically, so we have to
  figure out what to do here (either "fix it" by providing a different layout
  which contains the needed progress views, or find a different way to
  represent progress) - it probably makes sense to change it, especially due
  to both the way material design is moving.
 * Search - the panel doesn't look new. Can we fix this? should see [this
     article](https://chris.banes.me/2014/10/17/appcompat-v21/)
 * cleanup about (remove abs, and ideally, cleanup the strings, code, etc)
 * QuranActivity, TranslationManagerActivity, etc have config changes. they
   shouldn't. This may break dialogs.

QuranPageLayout is functionally equivalent to the previous layouts, with the
following exceptions:
1. portrait images were wrap/wrap, now they are match/match
2. translations were match/wrap, now they are match/match

Should consider which of those values is more "correct," while noting that
changing portrait images to wrap/wrap would require an adjustment in terms
of where the overlay page text is drawn.
